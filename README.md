# GRYDS
The Graphical Youtube Downloader Script, or GRYDS for short, is a simple and cross-platform GUI front-end for youtube-dl

## Requirements
If you are using the python script directly, you will need:

* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/)
* [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)
* [The Youtube_DL Python library](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/)
* [Tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/index.html)
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

The executable packages are created using PyInstaller. For those, the only requirement is FFmpeg.

## That is all
I hope you find this script useful!
