# GRYDS
The Graphical Youtube Downloader Script, or GRYDS for short, is a simple and cross-platform GUI front-end for youtube-dl

## Requirements
If you are using the python script directly, you will need:

* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/)
* [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)
* [The Youtube_DL Python library](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/)
* [Tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/index.html)
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

The executable packages are created using PyInstaller and the setup packages are created using the Inno Setup Compiler. The Windows packages include compiled FFmpeg binaries by [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (not affiliated with this project).

## That is all
I hope you find this script useful!
